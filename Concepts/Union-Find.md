A DSU data structure can be used to maintain knowledge of the connected components of a graph, and query for them quickly. In particular, we would like to support two operations:

dsu.find(node x), which outputs a unique id so that two nodes have the same id if and only if they are in the same connected component, and:

dsu.union(node x, node y), which draws an edge (x, y) in the graph, connecting the components with id find(x) and find(y) together.

To achieve this, we keep track of parent, which remembers the id of a smaller node in the same connected component. If the node is it's own parent, we call this the leader of that connected component.
