Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

```
Sample 1:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Sample 2:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Sample 3:
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

Sample 4:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false

```
